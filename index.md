The **Open Trading API specification** is an initiative driven by the **Open Trading API Workgroup** (OTAW) to set a standard for accessing **web**-based financial trading APIs. An increasing number of brokers are creating web-based APIs to allow their clients to access market data, view and submit orders, retrieve their account details and trading history or e.g. receive market indicators. This initiative has a similar set of objectives as those covered by the [FIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Information_eXchange) protocol but is aimed at web-based trading APIs, currently popular with smaller financial institutions, fintech companies and retail clients.

### Why a standard for web-based Trading APIs?

An increasing number of fintech companies and startups are developing web and mobile trading applications such as e.g. social trading apps, game-based trading apps, etc. This standard will enable them to interact with brokers which adhere to the standard therefore reducing the need to write bespoke integration solutions.

### What's next?

Further details about this initiative and how get involved will follow soon.
